# Sentiment Analysis Using ML

## Description

This project is designed to analyze and process textual data using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. It includes the following functionalities:

### 1. Text Cleaning
The project provides functions to clean text data by removing unnecessary characters, converting to lowercase, handling contractions, removing stopwords, and lemmatizing words. Clean text is essential for accurate NLP analysis.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed to determine the sentiment of the text, whether it's positive, negative, or neutral. This project utilizes the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool, which is specifically designed for sentiment analysis of social media texts.

### 3. Aspect Sentiment Analysis
Aspect sentiment analysis aims to identify aspects or topics within the text and evaluate the sentiment associated with each aspect. It extracts noun chunks from the text and analyzes the sentiment of each chunk using VADER.

### 4. Keyword Extraction
Keyword extraction is performed to identify key themes or topics within the text. This project uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for keyword extraction, which measures the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.

## Installation

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
!pip install nltk pandas spacy gensim sklearn
```

## Usage

First, make sure to download necessary NLTK data by running the following code:

```python
import nltk

nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
```

Then, you can utilize the functionalities provided by the project. Below is a basic example of how to use it:

```python
def main():
    # Your main function here

# Call the main function
main()
```

## Example

Suppose you have an article text you want to analyze. You can input the text and the program will perform various analyses on it, including cleaning the text, analyzing sentiment, aspect sentiment, and extracting keywords.
